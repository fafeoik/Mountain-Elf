This is the project that i'm currently working on. This is Third Person PRG game. It's not ready yet but you can check this out.
You can pickup some items by pressing E button. Behind the house there are gold sack which you can pick up and use to buy sword by vendor.
Also there are three potions in the start location which can be used for healing by pressing H button(Only if your hp is not full)).
 To take sword in your hand use Left mouse button and for putting it back use Q.
